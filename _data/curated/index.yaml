    <p>This is my online domain where I work to understand the world of the Application Programming Interfaces, also known as APIs. This new way of sharing data using the web is touching almost every aspect of our increasingly digital lives, providing access to the bits and bytes that make our personal and professional worlds go round.</p>
    <p>This is my research specifically into the world of API definitions, and what common definitions, standards, schema, and specifications are being used across the API space. I've been tracking API since it started becoming a thing back in 2012, and in 2017 it has become a full fledged discipline, with a wealth of services and tooling.</p>
    <p>API Evangelist is a network of data driven projects and APIs which I curate and manage as part of this ongoing research, hoping to provide easy access to the moving parts of my work. Everything you see here runs on Github, making everything forkable, and reusable for both humans and machines.</p>

    <p>As I keep an eye on the space I curate news, bookmark organizations, watch interesting tools, and try to understand what definitions are being applied by leading API providers. I take everything I find and publish here as part of my research.</p>
    <p>I then take this research, and what I've learned and publish stories on the blog, and more long form content like my industry guides, and white papers for customers. This is one way that I generate revenue to keep it all going.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to see me focus more on API definitions I could use more partners investing in this area, helping me find the time to study more about what is going on. Feel free to contact me directly if you want to talk more about API definitions.</p>

    <p>This is my research specifically into how database are used to deploy APIs. A significant portion of the APIs deployed today are simply a wrapper for one or many databases. This has caused an evolution in what is a database, as well as the seamless deployment, and evolving of APIs natively part of the database platform.</p>

    <p>As I keep an eye on the space I curate news, bookmark organizations, watch interesting tools, and work to understand what deployment solutions are being applied by leading API providers. I take everything I find and publish here as part of my research.</p>
    <p>I then take this research, and what I've learned and publish stories on the blog, and more long form content like my industry guides, and white papers for customers. This is one way that I generate revenue to keep it all going.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to see me focus more on database APIs I could use more partners investing in this area, helping me find the time to study more about what is going on. Feel free to contact me directly if you want to talk more about database APIs.</p>

    <p>As I keep an eye on the space I curate news, bookmark organizations, watch interesting tools, and work to understand what deployment solutions are being applied by leading API providers. I take everything I find and publish here as part of my research.</p>
    <p>I then take this research, and what I've learned and publish stories on the blog, and more long form content like my industry guides, and white papers for customers. This is one way that I generate revenue to keep it all going.</p>
    <p>If you'd like to see me focus more on API logging I could use more partners investing in this area, helping me find the time to study more about what is going on. Feel free to contact me directly if you want to talk more about API logging.</p>

    <p>This is my online domain where I work to understand the world of the Application Programming Interfaces, also known as APIs. This new way of sharing data using the web is touching almost every aspect of our increasingly digital lives, providing access to the bits and bytes that make our personal and professional worlds go round.</p>
    <p>This is my research specifically into the microservices evolution of the API conversation. I'm looking to understand the variety of philosophies that surround the microservices world, and the realities of it on the ground in companies and organizations of all shapes and sizes.</p>
    <p>API Evangelist is a network of data driven projects and APIs which I curate and manage as part of this ongoing research, hoping to provide easy access to the moving parts of my work.

    <p>This is my research specifically into the concept of scraping, and it's relationship to APIs. Scraping is everywhere, but many companies do not like talking about it. Scraping can be used to gather content for deploying an API, while APIs can also be used to alleviate the scraping of other web data and content. The intersection of scraping and APIs is always a fascinating thing for me to study.</p>

    <p>This is my online domain where I work to understand the world of the Application Programming Interfaces, also known as APIs. This new way of sharing data using the web is touching almost every aspect of our increasingly digital lives, providing access to the bits and bytes that make our personal and professional worlds go round.</p>
    <p>This is my research specifically into how software development kits (SDK) are used as part of the API integration lifecycle. My SDK research focuses on how full SDKs, as well as samples, platform integration kits, and other code related elements. This is just my bucket for understanding anything code related on both the server and client side.</p>

While I feel like APIs can be empowering I feel more often than not they are used for surveillance in support of this new form of capitalism. This is everything I"m gathering to support my arguments against API surveillance in the name of policing, capitalism, or many other forms that have emerged.</p>
